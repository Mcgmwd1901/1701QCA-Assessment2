# 1701QCA Making Interaction - Assessment 2 workbook

You will use this workbook to keep track of your progress through the course and also as a process journal to document the making of your projects. The comments in italics throughout the template give suggestions about what to include. Feel free to delete those instructions when you have completed the sections.

When you have completed the template, submit the link to the GitHub Pages site for this repository as a link in Learning@Griffith.

## Other research ##
*Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it.*

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

*Provide a link, reference, or whatever is required for somebody else to find the resource. Then provide a few comments about what you have drawn from the resource.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
My design intent is to make a device that helps with procrastination. This idea is to be used for both people with hearing disabilities,ADHD and people without. The design I hope to make is a system that the user puts on their desk and will have a countdown timer that then will alert the user to hopefully keep them on track and focused.
### Design concept 1 ###

### Design concept 2 ###

### Final design concept ###
For my Final design I have chosen to put the buzzer on the front as it will be pointing towards the user and as sound is therefore projected towards the user instead of in the general area making it more alert and giving a reason for the user to interact with the object. I decided to keep the light on the top this was done for deaf people, the light is set to go off when the buzzer does thus making it user friendly for people with hearing disabilities.

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
